# Monopoly Deal Simplified Implementation Plan

## Current State Analysis

The current Monopoly Deal implementation is a complex web application with:

1. **Game State Management**: Comprehensive state tracking with complex win conditions
2. **Card System**: Various card types (money, property, actions) with specific behaviors
3. **UI Components**: Player areas, card displays, interactive elements
4. **Event Handling**: For user interactions like drawing cards, playing cards, ending turns

## Simplification Goals

1. Maintain all card types and their functionalities
2. Retain the current UI layout and visual elements
3. Simplify the game logic for core actions:
   - Starting the game
   - Drawing cards
   - Playing properties
   - Making properties clearly visible

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Core Game State Simplification

- Reduce game state complexity
- Maintain essential state properties:
  - Game started status
  - Current player
  - Player hands, properties, money piles
  - Deck and discard pile
  - Cards played/drawn this turn

### 2. Maintain Card Functionality

- Preserve all card types in `cards.js`
- Retain card rendering and display logic
- Ensure cards can be played correctly

### 3. Simplify Core Gameplay Functions

- **Start Game**: Initialize deck, deal cards, set initial state
- **Draw Cards**: Allow drawing cards from the deck
- **Play Properties**: Enable playing property cards to the board
- **Play Money**: Allow adding money cards to money piles
- **End Turn**: Switch active player and reset turn state

### 4. UI Interaction Improvements

- Ensure clear visual feedback for game actions
- Make property cards prominently visible
- Maintain consistent UI state with game logic

### 5. Error Handling and Edge Cases

- Add validation for user actions
- Handle empty deck scenario
- Ensure smooth player transitions

## Coding Approach

1. First update `gameState.js` with a simplified game state structure
2. Modify core functions to use simplified logic
3. Update `scripts.js` to handle UI interactions with the simplified state
4. Test the core gameplay loop: start game → draw cards → play properties → end turn

## Features to Prioritize

1. **Card Rendering**: Ensure cards display correctly with appropriate styling
2. **Hand Management**: Allow players to see and interact with their cards
3. **Property Placement**: Make sure properties are clearly visible when played
4. **Game Flow**: Maintain the basic turn structure and rules

## Features to Simplify or Defer

1. Complex payment/rent calculations
2. Advanced action card effects
3. Detailed animation effects
4. Win condition checking (simplified version)

## Testing Plan

1. Test starting a new game
2. Test drawing cards
3. Test playing property cards
4. Test playing money cards
5. Test ending a turn
6. Verify UI updates correctly reflect game state

This implementation plan will guide the simplification while ensuring the core game functionality and visual presentation remain intact.

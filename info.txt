Special Gameplay Notes
Just Say No can cancel any action, including another Just Say No.
When an action card targets a player, they should see a Just Say No option (even if grayed out). This prevents opponents from knowing if they have one.
Full Multicolor Wildcards have no bank value and cannot be used as payment in a trade.
Pass Go allows you to draw two extra cards.
Wild Rent now only charges one player (instead of all).
Double The Rent must be paired with a Rent card to take effect.

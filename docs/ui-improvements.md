# Money Display UI Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the UI improvements made to the money display in the Monopoly Deal game to create a more space-efficient, horizontally-oriented layout that clearly separates the money display from the payment controls.

## Implemented Changes

### 1. Layout Restructuring

- Reduced the height of money denomination boxes from 40px to 30px
- Created a horizontal layout with the "Money" label on the left side
- Positioned denomination boxes in a rectangular container to the right of the "Money" label
- Arranged denomination boxes in a horizontal row
- Enhanced the responsive design for smaller screens

### 2. Payment Button Repositioning

- Moved the PAY button completely outside of the money denomination container
- Positioned it on the right side of the main money section
- Made the button more rectangular (70px width, 30px height)
- Maintained its attention-grabbing styling and pulsing animation

### 3. Keyboard Navigation

- Ensured keyboard shortcuts (pressing "1" or "2" to switch perspectives) work at all times
- Made shortcuts work during payment processing (removed previous restrictions)
- Added a tooltip in the money section indicating these shortcuts are available

## Technical Implementation

### CSS Changes

- Updated the money section to use flexbox for horizontal layout
- Reduced box heights and adjusted padding for better space efficiency
- Created separate positioning for the payment button
- Added styles for keyboard shortcut tooltip
- Added media queries for responsive design on smaller screens

### JavaScript Changes

1. Updated `updatePlayerMoneyUI` function in gameState.js:

   - Changed layout structure with "Money" label on the left
   - Positioned denomination boxes in a horizontal row to the right
   - Moved the PAY button outside the money denomination container
   - Added keyboard shortcut tooltip

2. Updated keyboard shortcuts in scripts.js:
   - Removed restrictions during payment processing
   - Made perspective switching shortcuts work at all times

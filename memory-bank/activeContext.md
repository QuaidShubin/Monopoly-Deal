# Monopoly Deal - Active Context

## Current Work Focus

We're currently improving the user interface and game mechanics:

1. **Payment System Enhancement**: Completely redesigned the payment interface with a denomination-based selection system, visual progress tracking, and simplified payment flow.
2. **UI Improvements**: Enhanced UI elements with better animations, visual feedback, and responsive design.
3. **Game Flow Refinement**: Streamlined the payment process and improved keyboard shortcuts for better player experience.

## Recent Changes

### 1. Payment System UI Overhaul

- Completely redesigned the payment interface with a denomination-based selection system
- Implemented intuitive +/- controls for each money denomination
- Added a prominent progress bar that shows payment completion percentage
- Created a clear visual distinction for selected denominations
- Added animations and visual feedback for payment interactions
- Implemented a "MAKE PAYMENT" button that enables when sufficient funds are selected
- Improved the payment flow with clearer visual indicators and feedback

### 2. UI Improvements

- Enhanced CSS styling with better animations and transitions
- Added ripple effects to counter buttons for better interaction feedback
- Improved the visual appearance of selectable payment assets with pulsing animations
- Made the progress bar gradient-colored with smooth transitions
- Added hover effects and visual feedback throughout the payment interface
- Fixed button positioning issues to prevent UI elements from moving out of view
- Improved the overall visual consistency of the game interface

### 3. Keyboard Shortcuts

- Implemented keyboard shortcuts for switching player perspectives (1 for Player 1, 2 for Player 2)
- Ensured keyboard shortcuts work consistently with the game state
- Removed incomplete spectator mode to prevent confusion
- Made sure perspective switching is properly restricted during payment scenarios
- Improved the visual feedback when switching perspectives

### 4. Code Improvements

- Simplified the payment processing code
- Improved code organization for payment-related functions
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback
- Fixed issues with button states and UI updates
- Ensured consistent behavior across different game states

## Previous Investigation

We were investigating two main issues:

1. **Cards Not Responding to Clicks**: Fixed by correcting perspective handling, card playability checks, the `isCurrentPlayerTurn` calculation, and data attribute handling
2. **Action Modals Not Displaying**: Fixed by improving the modal system with better error handling and debugging

The investigation focused on these areas:

1. **Card Playability Logic**: Identifying why cards weren't playable even when all conditions seemed to be met
2. **Data Attribute Handling**: Ensuring card indexes are properly stored and retrieved
3. **Event Flow**: Tracing the path from click to card action to identify breakpoints
4. **Modal Display System**: Identifying why the action selection modal wasn't appearing when cards were played
5. **Cancel Button Handling**: Fixing issues with the cancel button not working properly in the modal
6. **Action Card Handling**: Implementing specific actions for different card types
7. **Game State Flags**: Ensuring proper tracking of game state for card playability

## Known Issues

1. **Duplicate Functions**: There are multiple implementations of some functions (e.g., `togglePlayerAreas`) causing potential conflicts
2. **State Management**: Inconsistent state updates across different game actions
3. **Error Handling**: Limited error handling for edge cases
4. **Event Bubbling**: Some click events may be captured by parent elements unintentionally

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Test Payment System**: Verify that the new denomination-based payment system works correctly
2. **Test Keyboard Shortcuts**: Ensure perspective switching works properly in all game states
3. **Refine Visual Design**: Further improve the visual design of the game UI
4. **Add Missing Card Actions**: Implement any missing card action types

### Medium-Term Improvements

1. **Implement More Card Actions**: Add functionality for all the different action card types
2. **Refactor Duplicate Functions**: Merge duplicate implementations and ensure consistent behavior
3. **Improve Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling throughout the codebase
4. **Enhance UI Feedback**: Add more visual cues for valid actions and game state changes

### Long-Term Goals

1. **Code Reorganization**: Better separation of concerns between game logic and UI
2. **Performance Optimization**: Reduce unnecessary DOM updates and improve rendering efficiency
3. **Enhanced Features**: Add customizable rules, game saving/loading, and potentially AI opponents

## Current Decisions

1. **Modal Architecture**: Use a consistent approach for displaying modals using the `showActionOptions` function
2. **Card Action Implementation**: Implement specific actions for each card type using a switch statement in `playActionCard`
3. **Debug-First Approach**: Add comprehensive logging to trace issues with game flow and UI interactions
4. **Error Handling**: Add progressive error handling focusing first on critical paths
5. **Direct Card Handling**: Directly call `playCardWithIndex` from the card click handler to bypass event complexities
6. **Payment UI**: Use a denomination-based selection system with +/- controls and a progress bar for payment status

## Technical Questions to Resolve

1. How to best implement the full range of card actions (Deal Breaker, Just Say No, etc.)?
2. What's the optimal way to handle targeting other players for card actions?
3. How should we implement the rule that you can play 3 cards per turn?
4. How to handle special cases like Double The Rent which counts as its own action?
5. What's the best approach to implement the payment system for cards like Debt Collector?
6. Should we add more animation effects for card movements to enhance user experience?
7. How to handle complex action cards that require multiple steps (e.g., Deal Breaker)?
8. What's the best approach for implementing the Just Say No counter-action?
9. How to properly validate property sets for actions like Deal Breaker?
10. What's the optimal way to handle wildcard property assignments?

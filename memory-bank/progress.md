## Debugging Progress

1. **Fixed card drawing**: The draw pile click handler works correctly
2. **Fixed hasDrawnCards tracking**: Added logs confirm this flag is set after drawing 2 cards
3. **Fixed card click handler**: Updated with a more flexible allowCardPlay check
4. **Fixed isCurrentPlayerTurn calculation**: Cards are now properly identified as playable
5. **Enhanced data attribute handling**: Card indexes are now properly stored and retrieved
6. **Improved click event flow**: Bypassing handleCardPlay to directly call playCardWithIndex
7. **Fixed action modals**: Cards now display the correct action options when clicked
8. **Implemented basic card actions**: Pass Go and Rent cards now have their basic functionality
9. **Implemented centralized validation**: Created a robust validation system that eliminates "Unknown reason" errors
10. **Fixed script dependencies**: Ensured proper script loading order in index.html
11. **Added step-by-step validation**: Enhanced debugging with detailed validation results
12. **Added payment request handling**: Implemented proper payment request initialization and cleanup
13. **Enhanced discard functionality**: Fixed discardCard to properly update UI and handle timeouts
14. **Added debug toggle for opponent cards**: Implemented a toggle to show/hide opponent cards for debugging
15. **Improved UI organization**: Created a dedicated ui.js file for UI helper functions

Testing should now confirm that cards can be clicked, action modals appear correctly, and basic card actions function properly, allowing for normal gameplay progression. The centralized validation system should provide clear, specific error messages instead of "Unknown reason" errors.
